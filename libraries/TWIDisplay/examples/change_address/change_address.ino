 * Address change: Shows how to change the slave address of a device
 *
 * After changing the address, you must reset or toggle power on your device.
 * To see the current address of a device at any time, plug in VCC and GND only,
 * and wait for several seconds. The address will be shown in the display.
 *
 * The address will be displayed as a decimal number, prefixed by the letter A,
 * for instance A018, which is the default address (0x12 in HEX)
